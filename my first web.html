	<p> <blockquote>student Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) is a skill training program designed to prepare and expose students of the University to the industrial work situation they are likely to meet after graduation. Experts are of the opinion that there is a yearning gap between the learning acquired by undergraduates and the skills application required in the workplace. Clearly academic learning and theoretical knowledge alone will not bridge the gap that exist between the world of work and the academia. The need for the establishment of the scheme aroused when there was a growing concern among industrialists that graduates of institutions of higher learning lacked adequate practical background required for employment in industries. Thus, the employers were of the opinion that the theoretical education in higher institutions was not responsive enough to the needs of the employers of labor.</blockquote> </p>
<p>In line with the foregoing, SIWES program was designed to complement   classroom teaching in the course of studies and to acquaint students with the skills needed in the industries after graduation. The program forms part of the prerequisites for the award of B.Sc. and carries a number of credit units in the University curriculum. The scheme is funded by the Federal Government of Nigeria and jointly coordinated by the National Universities Commission (NUC) and Industrial Training Fund (ITF).</p>
<p>SIWES was established by ITF in 1973 to solve the problem of lack of adequate practical skills preparatory for employment in industries by Nigeria graduates of tertiary institutions.</p>
